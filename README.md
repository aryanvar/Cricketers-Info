## Suresh Raina
Arguably among India's finest T20 batsmen, Suresh Raina stormed into the international scene as a teenage prodigy during the Greg Chappell regime. Typical left-hander's elegance, power game and a fine temperament were the hallmark of Raina the batsman and he exhibited it beautifully during his ODI debut in 2005. After a stupendous start though, his form dipped over the next year and that was followed by a serious injury which meant that the career had hit a roadblock towards the latter part of 2007. The talent was obvious but Raina needed to translate that on the field as well. That's when the IPL Caravan debuted in 2008.

## Gautam Gambhir
Gautam Gambhir's cricketing career has all the trappings of a typical Bollywood flick- the glamour, the drama, the passion, the chutzpah, the wrangles, and of course the proverbial acche din and bure din.

Gambhir's journey as a first-class cricketer began in the 1999-2000 season. But, it was a couple of years later, in 2002, that the Delhi lad first stole the spotlight. Then playing for the Board President's XI against a touring Zimbabwe team, the left-hander smashed a double century scoring 218 runs. A year later, came the big moment: Gambhir secured his place in the Indian team for the TVS Cup, a triangular fixture.

Karthik has also worked occasionally as a commentator/pundit for British channel Sky Sports between 2020 and 2021, most notably during India's tour of England.

## KAPIL DEV

Kapil Dev was known for his energetic curved run-up and lethal outswingers as a result of that open-chested action. With the bat, he was an aggressive lower-middle order batsman who could cause carnage with the bat in an era before helmets, monster bats, or T20s. On the field, he was known for his inspirational leadership and athletic fielding. Perhaps the fittest and most disciplined man in the Indian dressing room at the time, Kapil is still remembered for that backward running catch of Sir Vivian Richards. Furthermore, Kapil Dev never missed a Test match due to fitness issues. It would be fair to say that his value to the team lay beyond numbers, but even the stats bow down before him: he remains the only man in the history of the game to have taken 400 wickets and scored more than 5000 runs in Test cricket - making him one of the greatest all-rounders of all time.

Kapil made his debut in 1978 and gradually started to produce performances of substance, especially in Test cricket. In his early years, he came across as a raw talent who was keen on just 'ripping his shoulder off' every ball, and 'tonking the leather off the ball' when he had the bat. The approach saw him score India's fastest Test half-century (off 33 balls) against Pakistan in his very third match. He came of age in the home series against Pakistan in 1979-80, where his all-round performances (32 wickets and 278 runs) helped India win 2 Tests. In the series, he became the youngest player to reach 100 wickets and 1000 runs in Test cricket. For the next two seasons, steady performances with the ball and useful contributions with the bat made him a certainty in the side and a viable candidate for captainship. Perhaps due to the nascent stages of the format or his priorities stacked up in favour of Test cricket, his ODI performances didn't quite live up to his antics in Test cricket.


And then, it happened. Kapil Dev replaced Sunil Gavaskar in the 1982-83 season and was appointed the captain for the 1983 World Cup to be played in England. He played one of the best ODI innings of all time in a must-win match against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells, where India were reeling at 17 for 5. Without any official telecast of the match due to a BBC strike, Kapil strode out and tore apart the Zimbabwean bowling to hammer 175\* off 138 balls - a lesson in counter-attacking cricket, and a lesson decades ahead of its time. The scarcely believable knock gave India the momentum which they seized, and went on to win the coveted vessel of victory for the first time, beating the West Indies in the league stages, the hosts in the semi-final, and finally, edging the mighty West Indies yet again in a low-scoring final at Lord's.

## RISHABH PANT

At 19, Rishabh Pant has gone through all the highs and lows of a cricketing career. A promising talent from Delhi, Pant came into reckoning after his exploits for India Under-19 in the 2016 World Cup. A dashing left-handed wicket-keeper batsman, he lit up the tournament with a blitzing 24-ball 75, the fastest half-century of the tournament, against Nepal and followed it up with a century against Namibia. India lost the title round - but came back with several positives - nothing bigger than the emergence of Pant.

And then, it happened. Kapil Dev replaced Sunil Gavaskar in the 1982-83 season and was appointed the captain for the 1983 World Cup to be played in England. He played one of the best ODI innings of all time in a must-win match against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells, where India were reeling at 17 for 5. Without any official telecast of the match due to a BBC strike, Kapil strode out and tore apart the Zimbabwean bowling to hammer 175* off 138 balls - a lesson in counter-attacking cricket, and a lesson decades ahead of its time. The scarcely believable knock gave India the momentum which they seized, and went on to win the coveted vessel of victory for the first time, beating the West Indies in the league stages, the hosts in the semi-final, and finally, edging the mighty West Indies yet again in a low-scoring final at Lord's.

## Cheteshwar Arvind Pujara

Cheteshwar Arvind Pujara is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test cricket for India and represents Saurashtra in domestic cricket. He is a right-handed batsman who made his first-class debut for Saurashtra in December 2005 and made his Test debut at Bangalore in October 2010.
He was a part of the India A team which toured England in the 2010 summers and was the highest scorer of the tour. In October 2011, the BCCI awarded him a D grade national contract. Known to have a sound technique and the temperament required to play long innings, he was one of the contenders for a spot in the Indian middle order after the retirement of Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman.[3] and was a part of the IPL 2021 winning team Chennai Super Kings.

## K.L. Rahul

KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batsmen in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final.

Rahul attracted plenty of attention at the subsequent IPL auction, and finally went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 1 crore (US$ 166,000 approx.). He was a regular member of their side in the 2014 season, mostly as wicketkeeper-batsman, but his contributions with the bat were steady rather than spectacular.

In the long format, however, his technique and application have impressed some of Indian cricket's most respected names. These include Rahul Dravid, with whom Rahul shares not just a name but also a strong rapport, regularly seeking him out for technical and mental advice.

Rahul had a middling tour of Australia with the India A team in July-August 2014, getting starts each time he batted in the unofficial Tests but only managing a top score of 52. But his appetite for runs was back to normal by the time the 2014-15 domestic season began, and twin centuries in the Duleep Trophy final earned him a place in India's Test squad on their tour of Australia.

A profitable IPL in 2016 set him up to make the Indian ODI and T20 squad that toured Zimbabwe in June, where he became the first batsman from his country to score a century on debut in 50-over cricket.
Karthik Krishnaswamy


## Chris Gayle

Twenty20 cricket seemingly picked Chris Gayle as its ambassador, for he scored the very first hundred in the format and now uncontestedly owns almost every record there is, including that of the most runs (now 10,000+), most hundreds, fastest hundred, and most fours and sixes.

Chris Gayle might stand tall at over six feet and wield his bat to make or break T20 leagues, but make no mistake about his affinity for Test cricket. His absenteeism from Tests later in his career may seem to suggest otherwise but Gayle has racked up 15 Test hundreds and over 7,000 runs across 103 matches so far, and frequently turns up for his many T20 franchises in jerseys numbered 333 - his highest First Class score, which he made against Sri Lanka at Galle, to become only the fourth batsman after Don Bradman, Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag with two Test triples in a lifetime.

Renowned as one of the most barbarous hitters of the cricket ball ever - he once swung a Brett Lee delivery past the Lord Tennyson school outside Oval! - Gayle dismissed footwork to a famous cricketing redundancy of his time, and along with other contemporary opening batsmen in Tillakaratne Dilshan, Virender Sehwag, and Brendon McCullum later, fashioned a batting era characterized by an unreal dependence on hand-eye coordination and breakneck run-scoring across formats. No wonder he became the first batsman to hit the first ball of a Test match for a six. And it's only fair that he beat Sehwag to become the fastest double centurion in ODIs, minting 215 off 147 in a World Cup game against Zimbabwe in Canberra, 2015.

## HARDIK PANDYA

Hardik Himanshu Pandya is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian national cricket team at the international level and the Baroda cricket team in Indian domestic cricket. He currently captains the newly debuted franchise Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and led them to their maiden IPL title in the 2022 edition. He is an all-rounder who bats right-handed and bowls right-arm fast-medium.

Hardik Pandya was born on 11 October 1993 in Surat, Gujarat. His father, Himanshu Pandya, ran a small car finance business in Surat which he shut down and moved to Vadodara when Hardik was five to provide his sons with better cricket training facilities. Himanshu Pandya worked as Loan agent in Vadodara. He enrolled his two sons into Kiran More's cricket academy in Vadodara. Lacking finances, the Pandya family lived in a rented apartment in Gorwa, with the brothers using a second-hand car to travel to the cricket ground. Hardik studied at the MK High School until ninth grade before dropping out to focus on cricket.

Hardik made steady progress in junior-level cricket, and according to Krunal, "won a lot of matches single-handedly" in club cricket. In an interview with the Indian Express, Hardik revealed that he was dropped from his state age-group teams due to his "attitude problems". He added that he was "just an expressive child" who did not "like to hide his emotions."

Hardik was a leg spinner until the age of 18 and turned to fast bowling at the insistence of the Baroda coach Sanath Kumar.

## SHREYAS IYER
Shreyas Iyer is an attacking top-order batsman capable of marrying classical shots with brute force. Iyer made headlines when Delhi Daredevils bought him at the 2015 IPL auction for a whopping INR 2.6 crore, and he repaid the faith with interest. Opening the batting, he aggregated 439 runs from 14 matches and went to win the IPL emerging player of the year award. By the end of the 2015-16 season, the hushed whispers calling for him to be fast-tracked to the national side had become a loud chorus as Iyer's career graph took another quantum leap in the Ranji Trophy. He amassed 1321 runs at an average of 73.38, including a century in the final, to help Mumbai storm to their 41st title.

Iyer had come through the Under-19 ranks, hitting back-to-back half-centuries in the playoffs to help India Under-19s finish fifth in the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. Iyer made his first-class debut for Mumbai in 2014-15, and after a lukewarm stint in the middle-order, Iyer was eventually promoted. He finished as the team's leading run-getter with 809 runs at an average of 50.56.

## DALE STEYN

Dale steyn is a south african international cricketer who plays for the south africa and in ipl for royal challengers banglore.

steyn made his Test debut in 2004, along with a fellow rookie by the name of AB de Villiers, after he impressed Ray Jennings with his raw pace and stamina, in the home series against England after a combined experience of just 7 first-class games. A humbling loss on debut set him back as he picked up just 3 wickets in the game, although it included a ripper of an outswinger to knock over Michael Vaughan in the second innings. After a tally of just 8 wickets in the 3-Test series, Steyn failed to make a significant impact and was dropped from the side.

## AB de Villiers

Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is a former South African international cricketer. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019.

Some cricketers' rise to the top constitutes hours of perseverance and hardwork, and others' include, predominantly, an abundance of talent and natural ability. Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is that player you create in a computer game, who has both the attributes set to maximum, and then some.

de Villiers has risen through the ranks to become one of the world's finest batsmen, most versatile batsmen, across all formats. When on song, de Villiers has the ability to take any bowling attack apart with his wide array of strokes on either side of the wicket. If his orthodoxy is compact and aesthetically pleasing, the South African avant-garde's trailblazing innovation often rendered bowlers speechless.

His supreme ability caught the eye of the selectors as he was fast-tracked into the national squad as a raw 20-year-old in 2004. He made his Test debut in the home series against England in 2004 and exhibited his class with a sublime 52 in just his fourth innings with the bat, saving South Africa from what looked like a certain defeat. He also registered his first Test century in the series - a fluent 109 on his home ground in Centurion. In short, he'd wasted no time and had shown the world his capability immediately.

Having played both as an opener and as a lower-order wicketkeeper/batsman in his first Test series, he soon proved his worth by amassing 460 runs in his first away tour to the Caribbean Islands in 2005. A slump in form ensued - de Villiers battled for runs against Australia both at home and away - he had to wait until the home series against West Indies in 2007-08 to again reach the three-figure mark. However, he made up for the lost time, spanking a fine 217 against India in Ahmedabad, the first South African player to hit a double ton against India.

It was plain sailing later on for the flamboyant right-hander as he scored runs for fun. It included a superb unbeaten 278 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in November 2010, briefly placing him at the top of the ladder for the highest individual score by a South African batsman before Amla's 311* at the Oval less than a year later.

de Villiers continued to grow in stature and improved his batting technique such that in addition to having the mainstream attacking game, he developed an impenetrable defence with a karate-style back-and-across trigger movement, and the late-block, which could be extended into the all-important check-drive to counter late movement off the pitch and in the air. This non-committal technique ended up making him one of the finest batsmen of the age. A compact defensive technique to stave off misbehaving balls on a minefield and a plethora of strokes in his armory to thrash the bowlers on truer wickets - AB de Villiers, the batting monster, had arrived.

Nevertheless, as great as things were in terms of individual performances, off-field events often seeped into his game. Following South Africa's exit from the 2011 World Cup, de Villiers was named as the captain of their ODI and T20I team in June. Owing to the workload and pressure, he gave up the T20I captaincy in early 2013 but continued to play as South Africa's main batsman and their first choice wicket-keeper.

Apart from his attacking strokeplay, de Villiers exhibited his ability to play the situation and conditions as well. With South Africa struggling to save the Adelaide Test against Australia during the tour Down Under in 2012-13, de Villiers curbed his natural instincts and dead-batted his way to a 220-ball 33 in one of the more exciting draws of all time, along with his partner-in-crime, Faf du Plessis. In the next Test at the WACA, his alter-ego showed up and he brutalized the red cherry on his way to a brisk 169 from just 184 balls as South Africa ruthlessly triumphed over Australia in their own backyard.

The face of innovation in modern-day cricket, AB's achievements in the limited-overs game are more qualitative than quantitative. Nevertheless, every so often, an innings of such outrageous audacity comes along that the maverick of AB stands out even on a dull, number-loaded scorecard. Ramps over the wicket-keeper, cheeky paddles past short fine or the audacious reverse sweeps and reverse-pulls off fast-bowlers, and countless other never-before-seen stunts have left bowlers, and by extension, even commentators dangerously breathless and short of words. Unquestionably, with his ability to maneuvre the field, his excellent hand-eye co-ordination, and his ability to cause the illusion that the bowler has bowled a poor ball, makes him a revolutionary in the modern game.

Case in point: On January 18, 2015, de Villiers smashed the West Indies bowlers to all corners of Johannesburg (and perhaps a few just about clearing the area code) en route to a record 31-ball 100 against a hapless West Indies line-up, beating the previous best in ODIs by five deliveries. The 44-ball 149 (yes, you read that right) included 9 fours and 16 sixes - it only took him 44 balls to equal Rohit Sharma's record tally of 16 sixes in an ODI. Donning the pink jersey, AB milked the bowlers in an unparalleled display of butchery.

AB de Villiers took 11 catches against Pakistan in Johannesburg in the 2012-13 season, equalling the record for most number of catches by a wicket-keeper in a Test match. He shares the record with former England keeper, Jack Russell. He also scored an unbeaten 103 in South Africa's second innings, becoming the first wicket-keeper to score a century and claim 10 dismissals in a Test. His batting antics coupled with his ability to pull off incredible catches and run-outs, and his cat-like reflexes on the field, make him one of the most valuable players in the modern game.

In December 2013, at the peak of his powers, de Villiers became the ninth batsman to top the batting rankings in both Tests and ODIs. He also had a wonderful three-match Test series against Australia, where he finished as the second highest run-scorer. He continued to do well in both Tests and ODIs and ended 2014 as the second-highest run-getter for South Africa in both formats, behind his team-mate Amla.


## BRETT LEE

Arguably the fastest bowler ever, Brett Lee was a potent weapon in Australia's armoury during their glory days of the 2000s. If facing Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne wasn't threatening enough, opposition batsmen rarely had the luxury of getting of taking a breather as they had to contend with the raw pace of Lee. Masterly with the new ball and equally if not more threatening with the older ball, the New South Wales pacer had every trick in the book which made him a complete fast bowler by all means. Generally, it was the outswinger that was Lee's major trump card although his pace meant that a searing yorker or a whizzing bouncer were always around the corner. A fast bowling great in the ODI format, Lee couldn't quite replicate the same amount of success in Tests although he did finish with over 300 scalps in the longest format. Clearly, injuries also hindered him but even then, he seemed to enjoy the 50-over format more.

Exceptional performances in the U17 and U19 section earned Lee plenty of accolades, scholarships and eventually, a national call up in 1999. It was in the Test squad that he got picked first and he celebrated it with a fifer on debut. He maintained the momentum over the next few Tests with a flurry of wickets at a fantastic average and healthy strike rate to make an emphatic statement to the cricketing world. Lee's Test success had seen him enter into the ODI squad as well and he seamlessly fitted into both the formats for Australia. The new few years saw middling returns in Tests for Lee whose body had started to creak due to his fondness for extreme speed. Injury prone pacers who bowl with high speeds tend to generally cut down on their speeds to prevent mishaps but Lee didn't believe in that theory. He always felt that his USP as a bowler was genuine pace and he wasn't willing to compromise on that part.

Lee's exceptional speeds meant that his variations as a bowler became doubly effective, often foxing the batsmen all ends up with this slower deliveries and off cutters. He had a good repertoire in his arsenal and this was a major reason for his immense success as an ODI bowler. Also, Ricky Ponting's captaincy saw Lee blooming further. Although he mostly played supporting role to McGrath and Gillespie, his steady maturity as a pacer soon made him a gun bowler. Lee enjoyed bowling on the grandest stage of them all - the World Cup where his wicket-taking ability used to be at its peak. He was part of the successive title-winning Australian squads of 2003 and 2007 while also taking part in the 2011 edition where they were eliminated in the quarterfinal. He played on for a year more before calling it quits from all forms of international cricket. A fragile body and an intention to prolong his limited-overs career had earlier forced him to retire from Tests in 2008.


## David Warner

David Warner (born 27 October 1986) is an Australian international cricketer and a former captain of the Australian national team in limited overs format and also a former test vice-captain.

Sourav Ganguly (48) was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), India to Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly.Sourav Ganguly initially played football as it is the favourite sport for the people of Kolkata but was later attracted to Cricket.He learnt cricket with his brother and despite being right-handed, he learnt to bat left-handed so that he could use his brother's sporting equipment. He scored a century against Orissa Under-15 and went on becoming the captain of St. Xavier's School's cricket team.

In 1989, Sourav Ganguly was selected to play for the Bengal team.After an impressive show in the Ranji Trophy in the 1990-91 season, the left-hander came into the limelight.

In 1992, he made his international debut against West Indies. It was not an ideal start as he could score just 3 runs batting at No. 6 in an ODI at the Gabba, Brisbane. He was dropped immediately due to his as he was perceived to be "arrogant" and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. He was removed from the team.

He then went back to domestic cricket and worked hard.In the 1995-96 Duleep Trophy, he scored 171 and was called back to the Indian side. He played to the National Team for a tour of England in 1996. For the single ODI, he played but was omitted from the team for the first Test. Later, Sourav Ganguly got a chance to make his Test debut.

It was the response to Andrew Flintoff who swayed his T-shirt at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai.As a captain by 2004, he had achieved significant success and was deemed as India's most successful captain by sections of the media. During his captaincy reign, his individual performance deteriorated especially after the World Cup, the tour of Australia in 2003, and in 2004 the Pakistan series. For the first time since 1969, Australia won a Test series in India.

Sourav Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth-highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution in the field of sports.

On 20 May 2013, the Government of West Bengal honoured Sourav Ganguly with the Banga Bibhushan Award.


## Kapil Dev

Kapil Dev was the greatest pace bowler India has produced, and their greatest fast-bowling allrounder. If he had played at any other time - not when Imran Khan, Ian Botham and Richard Hadlee were contemporaries - he would surely have been recognised as the best allrounder in the world. In any case he did enough to be voted India's Cricketer of the Century during 2002, ahead of Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. His greatest feats were to lead India almost jauntily, and by his all-round example, to the 1983 World Cup, and to take the world-record aggregate of Test wickets from Hadlee. It was the stamina of the marathon runner that took him finally to 431 wickets and only a yard beyond. He might not have been quite the bowling equal of Imran, Hadlee or Botham at his best, and his strike rate was less than four wickets per Test, but he was still outstanding in his accuracy and ability to swing the ball, usually away from right-handers. And he could hit a ball even more brilliantly than he bowled it, with uncomplicated flair.


## Lasith Malinga

## Sunil Gavaskar
Sunil Manohar Gavaskar (born 10 July 1949), is an Indian cricket commentator and former cricketer who represented India and Bombay from 1971 to 1987. Gavaskar is acknowledged as one of the greatest Batsman of all time. Gavaskar was widely admired for his technique against fast bowling, with a particularly high average of 65.45 against the West Indies, who possessed a four-pronged fast bowling attack regarded as the most vicious in Test history. However, most of Gavaskar's centuries against West Indies were against their second string team when their four-pronged attack were not playing together.His captaincy of the Indian team, however, was mentioned as less successful despite of team winning the Benson & Hedges World Championship of Cricket in 1985. Turbulent performances of the team led to multiple exchanges of captaincy between Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, with one of Gavaskar's sackings coming just six months before Kapil led India to victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup.Gavaskar is a recipient of the Indian sports honour of the Arjuna Award and the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan.He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009.In 2012, he was awarded the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award for Cricket in India.

## Ravi Shastri

Ravishankar Jayadritha Shastri (born 27 May 1962) is the former head coach of the India national cricket team, a cricket commentator and former captain of Indian Cricket Team. As a player, he played for the India national cricket team between 1981 and 1992 in both Test matches and One Day Internationals. Although he started his career as a left arm spin bowler, he later transformed into a batting all-rounder.

As a cricketer, Shastri was essentially defensive with his trademark "chapati shot" (a flick off the pads), but he could raise his strike rate when required. Due to his above-average height (he stood 6' 3" tall) and an upright stance, he had a limited number of shots against fast bowling, but was able to put the lofted shot to good use against spin bowling. Ravi played either as an opening batsman or in the middle order.

The highlight of his career was when he was elected Champion of Champions in the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. In the same season, on 10 January 1985, he equaled West Indian Garry Sobers's record of hitting six sixes in an over in first class cricket. He was regarded as a potential captain, but his image outside cricket, injuries and tendency to lose form at crucial times meant that he captained India in only one Test match.

In domestic cricket, he played for Bombay and led them to the Ranji Trophy title in his final year of playing. He also played four seasons of county cricket for Glamorgan. He was forced to retire aged 31 due to a recurring knee injury. He has done commentary on behalf of BCCI in the matches that India play.In 2014, he became the director of Indian cricket team for a period of eight months from India's tour of England till the 2015 World Cup. On 13 July 2017, he was appointed as the head coach of Indian cricket team.On 16 August 2019, he was re-appointed as the head coach of the senior men's Indian team and remained in charge until the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.

## James Anderson
James Michael Anderson OBE (born 30 July 1982) is an English international cricketer who plays for Lancashire County Cricket Club and the England cricket team. He is also a part time cricket commentator for the BBC. Among fast bowlers, Anderson is the leading wicket-taker of all-time at Test cricket level, being the only fast bowler to have taken 600 or more Test wickets; among all types of bowler, he is the third-highest wicket-taker overall.He also holds the record for the most wickets taken by an England player in One-Day International (ODI) cricket. In June 2021, he made his 174th appearance for England in Test cricket, becoming England's most capped player.He has also played nearly 200 One Day Internationals.He is regarded as one of the greatest swing bowlers in the history of cricket.

A right-arm fast swing bowler, Anderson made his international debut at the end of 2002 during England's winter tour of Australia, then played his first Test match against Zimbabwe when the team toured England the following summer. His early career was held back by injuries, including a stress fracture of the back which kept him out of action for most of the 2006 season, but thereafter he established himself as the key opening bowler in the England Test team. He was a regular strike bowler with the national one-day side, but has not participated in the shorter format of the game at international level since the 2015 World Cup.

Anderson was the first English bowler to reach 400, 500 and 600 wickets in Test matches. As of August 2022, he is ranked 6th in the ICC Test Bowling Rankings, having previously reached the top position at various times between 2016 and 2018.

## Ravi Shastri
Ravishankar Jayadritha Shastri (born 27 May 1962) is the former head coach of the India national cricket team, a cricket commentator and former captain of Indian Cricket Team. As a player, he played for the India national cricket team between 1981 and 1992 in both Test matches and One Day Internationals. Although he started his career as a left arm spin bowler, he later transformed into a batting all-rounder.

As a cricketer, Shastri was essentially defensive with his trademark "chapati shot"[1][2] (a flick off the pads), but he could raise his strike rate when required. Due to his above-average height (he stood 6' 3" tall) and an upright stance, he had a limited number of shots against fast bowling, but was able to put the lofted shot to good use against spin bowling. Ravi played either as an opening batsman or in the middle order.

The highlight of his career was when he was elected Champion of Champions in the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. In the same season, on 10 January 1985,[3] he equaled West Indian Garry Sobers's record of hitting six sixes in an over in first class cricket. He was regarded as a potential captain, but his image outside cricket,[4] injuries and tendency to lose form at crucial times meant that he captained India in only one Test match.
## Rishad Pant
Rishabh Rajendra Pant (born 4 October 1997), is an Indian cricketer who plays as a middle order wicket-keeper batter for India, Delhi, and captains the Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. He was the vice-captain of the India U-19 team for the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for India in January 2017, his Test debut in August 2018, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in October 2018. In January 2019, Pant was named the ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year at the 2018 ICC Awards. In February 2021, Pant was named the Men's Player of the Month in the first edition of the ICC Player of the Month Awards.

In June 2022, Pant was named as the Indian captain for the T20I series against South Africa, after the designated captain KL Rahul was ruled of the series due to an injury.

Pant made his first-class debut on 22 October 2015 in the 2015–16 Ranji Trophy and his List A debut the next month in the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy.

In the 2016–17 Ranji Trophy, while playing a match against Maharashtra, Pant scored 308 runs in an innings, becoming the third-youngest Indian to score a triple century in first-class cricket.

On 8 November 2016, Pant scored the fastest century in the Ranji Trophy, from just 48 balls, in Delhi's match against Jharkhand.

In February 2017, Pant was named Delhi's captain for the 2016–17 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He took over from Gautam Gambhir, who led Delhi to the final of the previous season. Delhi coach Bhaskar Pillai said it was a "consensus decision" to prepare Pant for the future.

On 14 January 2018, in the 2017–18 Zonal T20 League match between Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, Pant scored the second-fastest century in a Twenty20 match, making 100 from 32 balls.


## Mahendra Singh Dhoni

In 1995, M.S Dhoni joined the Commando cricket club and stood behind the stumps for them for the next three years. He was then picked for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship in the 1997/98 season and performed well.
In 1998, Dhoni started to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. During his time at the CCL, Deval Sahay would gift him fifty rupees for every 6 that he scored in Sheesh Mahal tournament cricket games. Sahay then pushed for Dhoni selection in the Bihar team.
Dhoni was selected in 1998 by Deval Sahay to play for the Central CoalFields Limited (CCL) team. This was the first time that Dhoni stepped into professional cricket. Dhoni showed exceptional talent which impressed Deval Sahay who used his contacts in Bihar Cricket Association to push for his selection in the Bihar team.
Dhoni debuted for the senior Bihar Ranji Team for the 1999 - 2000 season. He was also included in the Bihar U-19 squad for the 1998-99 season where he scored 176 runs in 7 innings from 5 matches.Dhoni however was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). Dhoni made the first-class debut in Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999 - 2000 season. He was just eighteen-year-old at that moment.
After playing Ranji Trophy for over three years, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone. It was then that Dhoni stepped into the limelight. Dhoni was scouted by BCCI small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW and discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar.
Dhoni was selected for India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. His performances in that tour earned him the attention of the likes of Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri.

## Christopher Henry Gayle
He was born on born 21 September 1979, is a Jamaican cricketer who is playing international cricket for the West Indies from 1999.[5] A destructive batter, Gayle is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen to have played Twenty20 cricket, and by some as the best ever.[6][7] He played a crucial role in the West Indies teams thawon 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20.

## Arshdeep Singh

This article covers a detailed story about Indian Cricketer Arshdeep Singh. It Covers more details about Arshdeep Singh Biography, Wikipedia, Wiki, Early Life, Age, Date of Birth, IPL 2022,birthday, Height in Feet, Body measurement, Career, jersey number 2, Bowling Speed, Caste, original name, real name, wife, photos, Affairs, Marital Status, Father, Mother, Siblings, sisters, family photos, Kids, Son, Daughter, Photos, About, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, House, Net Worth, IPL Salary, Facts, Occupation, Profession, Education, Education Qualification, Achievements, Awards, Photos, Videos, Gossips, News, Career & more.
Arshdeep Singh is an Indian international fast bowler who plays cricket for the Indian team. He is one of the leading fast bowlers of the Punjab Kings in IPL. He was born on 5 February 1999 in Guna, Madhya Pradesh. He made his List A debut for Punjab in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on 19 September 2018. He was part of the Indian squad in the 2018 ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup before making his List A debut. Seeing his excellent performance, Punjab Kings bought him in the IPL 2018 auction.
He made his IPL debut for Kings XI Punjab on 16 April 2019. In the 2019 IPL, he became the second-highest wicket-taker of that season due to his superb bowling. Apart from this, Arshdeep made his first-class debut for Punjab in the Ranji Trophy on 25 December 2019. In June 2021, he was included as a net bowler for the Indian teams tour of Sri Lanka. The last two T20Is on that tour saw him play for the Indian team after most of the Indian players tested positive for COVID-19.
In May 2022, he was selected for the Indian teams home T20 series against South Africa. He was included in the Indian ODI and T20 squads that toured England in June 2022. Arshdeep made his T20I debut on 7 July 2022, playing against England. In July 2022, he again got a place in the Indian team that toured the West Indies, where he took 7 wickets in the 5-match series and won the man of the series title. After this, on 8 August 2022, he was included in the Indian team that toured Dubai in the Asia Cup
Indias performance in the Asia Cup was quite disappointing and after Super 4 the team had to pull out of the tournament after losing two consecutive matches to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In a match between India and Pakistan in the same tournament, when the match was very exciting and at its final stage, Arshdeep missed a very simple catch of a Pakistani batsman. After which people started trolling him very badly on social media. The match was won by Pakistan by 5 wickets, after which Arshdeeps Wikipedia page was also tampered with.
Later tracing the IP address revealed that his page was vandalized from Pakistan. After dropping the catch, the trollers wrote on Arshdeeps Wikipedia page as a match player for Khalistan instead of India. Calling him a traitor also insulted him. Let us tell you that in that match between India and Pakistan also Arshdeep Singh bowled at an economy rate of 7.04 for 27 runs in 3.5 overs with a wicket. Even after missing the catch, Pakistan needed 27 runs. Pakistan needed seven runs in the last over, despite this Arshdeep defended the match for five balls and made Pakistan victory very difficult.

## Sachin Tendulkar
Sachin Tendulkar was the most complete batter of his time, the most prolific run-maker of all time, and arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known.
His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to genius batters - anticipation. If he didn't have a signature stroke (though the upright, back-foot punch comes close) it was because he was proficient at so many and could pull them out at will.
There were no apparent weaknesses in Tendulkar's game. He could score all around the wicket, off both feet, could temper his game to suit every situation, and made runs in all parts of the world, in all conditions.
Some of his finest performances came against Australia, the dominant team of his era. His century as a 19-year-old on a lightning-fast pitch at the WACA is considered one of the best innings ever to have been played in that country. A few years later he received the ultimate compliment from the ultimate batter: Don Bradman confided to his wife that Tendulkar reminded him of himself.
Blessed with the keenest of cricket minds, and driven by a loathing for defeat, Tendulkar established his greatness early. He was only 16 when he made his Test debut, and was hit in the face by Waqar Younis in that game, but continued to bat. His first Test hundred, a match-saving one at Old Trafford, came when he was 17, and he had 16 Test hundreds before he turned 25. In 2000 he became the first batter to have scored 50 international hundreds, in 2008 he passed Brian Lara as the leading Test run-scorer, and in the years after, he went past 13,000 Test runs, 30,000 international runs, and 50 Test hundreds.
He holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score his first ODI hundred until his 79th match. At just under 37 years of age, he made the first double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, a month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first player to score 100 international centuries, which, like Bradman's batting average, might be a mark that lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18 months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, he retired from Test cricket after a memorable 200th Test, against West Indies.
Tendulkar's considerable achievements seem greater still when looked at in the light of the burden of expectation he had to bear from his adoring but somewhat unreasonable followers, who were prone to regarding anything less than a hundred in every innings as a failure. He still remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world.

# Meghann Moira Lanning

Meghann Moira Lanning AM (born 25 March 1992) is an Australian cricketer who currently captains the national women's team. She has been a member of six successful world championship campaigns, winning two Women's Cricket World Cup and four ICC Women's World Twenty20 titles. Lanning holds the record for the most Women's One Day International centuries[1] and is the first Australian to score 2,000 Twenty20 International runs.[2][3] Domestically, she is the captain of Victoria in the Women's National Cricket League and the Melbourne Stars in the Women's Big Bash League

## Shubman Gill
Shubman Gill (born September 8, 1999) is the latest prodigy of India's familial batting production line. He shot to fame with 418 runs at an average of 104.50 in the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, where he served as Prithvi Shaw's deputy and batted at No. 3 to play a crucial role in India's record fourth world title. Also the edition's Player of the Tournament, Gill was a favourite in the 2018 IPL auctions and was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 280,000).

Gill won the BCCI award for the Best Junior Cricketer for consecutive years in 2013-14 and 2014-15, knocking hard on the doors of the U19 team. When picked, Gill starred in India's handsome 3-1 win at home over England in the Youth ODIs, scoring 351 runs in 4 innings and then went on to match up to his high standards in his first tour of England soon after. India whitewashed the hosts 5-0 and Gill top-scored again with 278 runs across 4 innings.

With India facing the eternal number-four issue, many felt Gill would be punted with the World Cup not far away but after a handful of games (that too on extremely tough surfaces), he found himself out of the squad. Of course, the selectors and he himself knew that age is on his side and that his time would come. In the 2019 IPL, he batted in the top order and on expected lines, managed to create a bigger impact. However, it’s his exploits in red-ball cricket that’s convinced people of his completeness as a batsman. By churning out runs for fun in his brief First-class career thus far, Gill has now staked a claim for a spot across formats and has rightly been picked as a back-up opener for the home Tests against South Africa.

## Sam Curran
His father being a national cricketer for Zimbabwe - Sam Curran (born June 3, 1998) is one of the many white African cricketers of this decade to have moved out of his traditional roots and to have relocated in the United Kingdom to ply his trade. A diminutive, mild-looking left-arm seamer whose natural angle helps him swing the Dukes away from right-handers, he doubles up as an able batsman lower down the order; and given the ease he looks in with the bat, it could soon become his primary skill.

He was soon picked for the 2016 under-19 World Cup, followed by a spot in the England Lions' tour to the UAE later in the year. An injury to Ben Stokes meant that Sam was fast-tracked into national reckoning, getting his maiden Test cap at Headingly against Pakistan in June 2018. His biggest moment under the sun came in the home summer of 2018 against the then number one side in the world, India. Picked primarily as a bowler, it was his abilities with the bat from number seven that helped rescue England after middle-order collapses, match after match. It was no surprise when he was named the Man of the Series for his all-round contributions (272 runs and 11 wickets) that saw England win 4-1. He carried on his form into the Sri Lankan tour, playing a key role in England whitewashing the islanders.

And performances against India never go unrecognised monetarily. Despite being a relatively unknown quantity for his T20 exploits, Sam Curran's name at the IPL auction later in the year attracted a bidding war. In the end, he was sold for a colossal 7.2 crores INR to KXIP to become one of the biggest surprises at the auctions over the last twelve seasons. He endured a strictly average time in the IPL, with the lack of swing on Indian pitches making him cannon fodder at his pace which generally is the late 120s or early 130s. That said, he did have a game where he produced a hat-trick and has shown promise to be of use, except that it could be as a batting all-rounder. Sam is a clean striker of the ball and in T20, it's this attribute of his that will hold him in better stead while his bowling could be more of a bonus. CSK picked him at the 2020 IPL auctions and although he doesn't seem like a sure starter at this point. Sam is definitely a handy addition to the squad.

## Rashid Khan
Rashid Khan (born September 20, 1998) has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. Not a big turner of the ball, he puts batters under pressure with his speed through the air, like his bowling idol Shahid Afridi, while maintaining a stump-to-stump line. His biggest weapon is an accurate googly, and he has variations aplenty. With bat in hand he is more than capable of clearing the boundary late in an innings, and he has airbrushed many a middling total into a match-winning one for his team.

Rashid was just 17 when he made his ODI debut on Afghanistan's tour of Zimbabwe in October 2015. Less than two years later, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL for close to US$600,000. After a superb 17-wicket first season with them, he picked up franchise deals with Guyana Amazon Warriors - for whom he took the first-ever hat-trick in the CPL in 2017 - and Adelaide Strikers, with whom he won his (and their) first BBL title in 2018. He scaled new heights for Afghanistan as well, taking 5 for 3 in a T20I against Ireland to keep a record 11-match T20I winning streak alive, and later in 2017, taking his country to a win over West Indies in their first ODI in the Caribbean with 7 for 18. He was duly honoured as the 2017 ICC Associate Cricketer of the Year. The following year, he became the youngest cricketer to top the ODI bowling rankings, the youngest man to captain an international side, and the fastest to 100 ODI wickets.

In Afghanistan's inaugural year in Test cricket, Rashid took five second-innings wickets in their first win, against Ireland, and six months later made an important fifty and took twin five-fors, finishing with 11 wickets in a famous win over Bangladesh in Chattogram. In 2021, he took 11 again, this time in a win over Zimbabwe. In his five seasons with Sunrisers, he was a totemic presence, taking 93 wickets at an economy rate of 6.33. When he moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022, he took 19 wickets in a run that led the side to the title.

## Ollie Pope
Ollie Pope (born January 2, 1998) is an up-and-coming wicketkeeper-batsman with all the traits of the modern-day cricketer: innovative, fit, agile, and powerful. The 20-year-old cricketer rose through the ranks of age-group cricket and reached the peak of his powers in the 2017 season for Surrey, excelling with the bat in all three formats.

He made his List A debut in 2016, playing in the all-important Royal London Cup semi-final, where he was part of the winning side that contained 5 specialist keepers - naturally, he didn't don the gloves. He didn't make an impression with the bat, or at least the scoreboard won't reflect it, but Pope managed to show decent temperament in the context of the game to score a few quick runs at the death which ensured his place in the side for the final. Pope made his Twenty20 debut for Surrey in the 2017 NatWest T20 Blast on 7th July 2017 and has done well down the order with some pinch-hitting, although he might want to make amends to his relatively low strike-rate, which he has started to do of late.

Pope's consistency and the fetish of the England team management to blood youngsters meant he received a call-up during the home season of 2018, against the touring Indian team. Having batted at number six for Surrey right through, Pope was asked to bat at four on his debut at Lord's, a task which seemed beyond his ability. Two Tests later, he found himself out of the team, but was always in the horizon as the elegant right-hander was named in England's Test squad for the tour of New Zealand in late 2019.

## Tom Banton
A dynamic wicket-keeper batsman who burst into the England domestic scene in 2017, Tom Banton (born November 11, 1998) is a rising star for Somerset. Extremely unorthodox with the willow and lightning-quick behind the sticks, he’s already been touted as a potential successor to Jos Buttler. A product of the Warwickshire system and thereafter, the England U19, Banton’s skill set was explicitly obvious to all those who saw him play and he landed a contract at Somerset for the T20 blast in the 2017-18 season. Next year, he debuted in other formats as well and has been a regular for his county ever since. At this point, Banton looks ready made for white-ball cricket and a phenomenal T20 Blast campaign in 2019 showed how much he had progressed as a player. It wasn’t just the runs but also the manner in which he was manipulating the field with unconventional strokes that caught the eye. Fittingly, he found himself picked for the national side in the shortest format when they toured New Zealand in late 2019. Still early days in his career but if groomed well, there’s no denying that Banton will be England’s next superstar.

## Prithvi Shaw
Prithvi Shaw (born November 9, 1999) is not the first young Mumbai batsman to get heads turning in cricket, and most certainly won't be the last. A precocious child prodigy, Shaw has been created a bit of a stir in the Indian cricketing fraternity with a manic display of batting in Mumbai's Harris Shield as a mere 14-year-old - an unprecendented 546, the highest score in any competitive cricket at the time in more than a century until surpassed by one Pranav Dhanawade in 2016.

His Harris shield performance was followed by several others of note, including centuries on debut in both Ranji Trophy (2016-17) and Duleep Trophy (2017) - a feat only previously achieved only by the Great Sachin Tendulkar, thereby drawing comparisons of great magnitude with the little master and being hailed as one of the future batting mainstays of Indian cricket. After skyrocketing through grade- and age-level cricket, he was declared the captain of the Indian U-19 side for the 2018 Junior World Cup in New Zealand. With a capable leader in Shaw, a stellar bowling line-up, and under the keen eye of Rahul Dravid, India coasted to the title, as Shaw contributed handsomely with the bat, scoring 261 runs at an average of 65 with 2 fifties to his name.

Prithvi Shaw for long has been touted as the next big thing in Indian cricket and judging by that Delhi bought him at an excellent price of 1.2 Crores. Initially, he wasn't getting an opportunity to be a part of the playing eleven but the poor form of Gautam Gambhir opened the door for Shaw. He made most of his opportunities and got Delhi off to brisk starts on most occasions. He started off well with a 10-ball 22 and a flurry of aggressive innings over the course of the season and ended up cementing his spot in the side, running riot in the powerplay, before Rishabh Pant could cut loose at the death. Shaw will look to replicate those performances when he will churn out for Delhi this year.

## Smriti Mandhana
Smriti Shriniwas Mandhana is a prominent left-hand batswoman who plays for the Indian Cricket team. She was born on July 18, 1996, in Mumbai. She is the Vice-Captain
of the Indian Women's cricket team and also captained the side leading to many promising victories. In April 2013, she made her first International appearance in a
T20I match against Bangladesh. Five days later, she made her ODI debut. She scored her first century in just her second ODI game, scoring 102 against Australia in
Hobart. In the Women's T20 challenge she led her team Trailblazers to a magnificent victory in the final against SuperNovas to lift the trophy.The left-hander joined
the Brisbane Heat in the 2016–17 season, making her WBBL debut. Later, the Hobart Hurricanes signed Mandhana for the 2018–19 campaign.

Mandhana was awarded the best female cricketer of the year as well as the ODI player of the year in December 2018. She was aslo awarded the honorable 'Arjuna Award

## Lasith Malinga

Malinga announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on 14 September 2021.

Malinga's unorthodox action and dipping slower ball yorkers are credited with much of his success.He changed the dynamics and landscape of death bowling in limited overs cricket by bowling his toe crushing yorkers. He is best known for his ability to take consecutive wickets, with in-swinging yorkers: he is the only bowler in the world to have two World Cup hat-tricks,first bowler to take a double hatrick, the only bowler to have taken three hat-tricks in ODIs and only bowler to have two double hatricks. He is also the first bowler to take five hat-tricks across all formats of international cricket, and holds the record for most hat-tricks in international cricket.

##Shubhman Gill
Shubman Gill is the latest prodigy of India's familial batting production line. He shot to fame with 418 runs at an average of 104.50 in the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup, where he served as Prithvi Shaw's deputy and batted at No. 3 to play a crucial role in India's record fourth world title. Also the edition's Player of the Tournament, Gill was a favourite in the 2018 IPL auctions and was picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for INR 1.8 crore (USD 280,000).

Born in Fazilka, Punjab, Gill's precocious talents found an early fan in his father, Lakhwinder Singh, who shifted base to Mohali and rented a place near the PCA Stadium so that his son could grow up with better access to cricket. And it wasn't long until Gill started grabbing headlines. He scored 351 in Punjab's Inter-District U16 tournament in 2014, racking up an opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh, and then went on to strike a double hundred in his U16 debut for Punjab at the 2016 Vijay Merchant Trophy.

Gill made his List A debut for Punjab in the 2016-17 Vijay Hazare Trophy, batting one-down, and went on to make his first-class debut in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy against Bengal, where he batted as an opener to score his maiden half-century and stepped it up in just the next game with a maiden hundred against Services.

Gill won the BCCI award for the Best Junior Cricketer for consecutive years in 2013-14 and 2014-15, knocking hard on the doors of the U19 team. When picked, Gill starred in India's handsome 3-1 win at home over England in the Youth ODIs, scoring 351 runs in 4 innings and then went on to match up to his high standards in his first tour of England soon after. India whitewashed the hosts 5-0 and Gill top-scored again with 278 runs across 4 innings.

Gill easily looked the best batsman among his colleagues at the World Cup, comfortably overhauling even Prithvi Shaw, the 18-year-old Mumbai batsman who had the media houses buzzing with a whooping five first-class hundreds to his name. Gill's bottom-handed technique, made fashionably successful by Virat Kohli among many others, allowed him to play in a similar mould. He scored runs briskly, mixing quick singles and doubles with powerful hits across the ground, and stood out as much for his batting acumen as he did for his fielding prowess.

Once back from the World Cup in New Zealand, Gill soon found himself returning to the unglamorous grind, representing Punjab in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He started the tournament with modest scores of 25, 4 and 8 but soon recovered, flaying a match-winning 123 against a rampant Karnataka side.

Strong showings in the 2018-19 domestic season meant that Gill was seamlessly transitioning into being a senior India player. He even looked unnerved on the big stage of the IPL, despite batting out of position for the Kolkata Knight Riders. 2019 has turned out to be a potential career-turning year for the
Punjab youngster who first got picked for the ODIs in New Zealand where he also made his international debut.

With India facing the eternal number-four issue, many felt Gill would be punted with the World Cup not far away but after a handful of games (that too on extremely tough surfaces), he found himself out of the squad. Of course, the selectors and he himself knew that age is on his side and that his time would come. In the 2019 IPL, he batted in the top order and on expected lines, managed to create a bigger impact. However, it’s his exploits in red-ball cricket that’s convinced people of his completeness as a batsman. By churning out runs for fun in his brief First-class career thus far, Gill has now staked a claim for a spot across formats and has rightly been picked as a back-up opener for the home Tests against South Africa

Although it's still early days, Gill's heady mix of passion, hard work and genius promises to cultivate a career that should serve Indian cricket well in the times to come. Until then, it's a nervous wait time for Gill and the many observers of cricket.

## Deepak Hooda
An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname "Hurricane Hooda", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction.

Hooda's game is also suited to the longer formats. Appointed Baroda's captain at the start of the 2016-17 Ranji season, he reeled off three consecutive hundreds, including an unbeaten 293 against Punjab, but struggled to convert his starts thereafter. In 2021, Baroda suspended him for indiscipline after he left the T20 squad, having accused captain Krunal Pandya of "bullying" and using abusive language. He moved to Rajasthan the next season.

But Hooda patched things up with Pandya before the start of the 2022 IPL, and had a breakout season for Lucknow Super Giants under Pandya's captaincy. Immediately after, he scored his maiden T20I hundred - in only his third innings - against Ireland in Malahide and found himself included in the 2022 T20 World Cup squad.
